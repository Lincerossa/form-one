# 👋🏻 Welcome to FORM-ONE

## Why?

form-one is built onto the react-hook-form library (which is an amazing library itself 🦄).
With form-one it is an abstraction of the react-hook-form library, that reduce its complexity and lets you focusing just on the form structure.

## How?
The *ui* is made with ❤️ using the antd library and the *logic* is made abstracting the react-hook-form library.

You can use [form-one](https://github.com/Lincerossa/form-one) in React apps by just installing it
